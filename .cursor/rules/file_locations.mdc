- My app server is defined across various files but the routes are in [round_routes.py](mdc:trivia/server/routes/round/round_routes.py), [user_routes.py](mdc:trivia/server/routes/user/user_routes.py), [event_routes.py](mdc:trivia/server/routes/event/event_routes.py), [category_routes.py](mdc:trivia/server/routes/category/category_routes.py), [question_routes.py](mdc:trivia/server/routes/question/question_routes.py)  and on the front-end the route locations are in [api.ts](mdc:trivia/trivia/trivia-frontend/src/config/api.ts).
