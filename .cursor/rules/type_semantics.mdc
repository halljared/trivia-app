- Types are available in [trivia.ts](mdc:trivia-frontend/src/types/trivia.ts)
- `New` prefixed types are for referencing UI layer types that don't have server generated fields like createdOn or id.
- `API` suffix types are for the point when an object is fetched from the API.
- Un-prefix/suffix types are for items that have been parsed into distint objects after loading from the API. These are the backbone of the interface components generally speaking.
